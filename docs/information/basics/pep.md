# Pe, P

(Pe,P) is an initiative that both rewards long-term PENDLE holders and contributes value to the protocol by providing liquidity for Pendle/ETH OT and YT pools.

These pools allow users to speculate and hedge their AMM swap fees, giving a good example of how much deeper the DeFi space can expand beyond traditional finance.

(Pe,P) grants the protocol stickier liquidity by creating an incentivized token layer on top of the Pendle/ETH Pool while giving it more utility. As PENDLE forms a large component of this, the pools predominantly reward users who provide their PENDLE liquidity.

In essence, (Pe,P) achieves 3 objectives:

* Increase PENDLE liquidity and creates a stickier pool-2 incentive
* Provide liquidity to the protocol (i.e. PENDLE/ETH)
* Reward users that contribute the most to the protocol

:::note
The equivalent on Avalanche would be (Pa,P), using PENDLE/AVAX pool.
