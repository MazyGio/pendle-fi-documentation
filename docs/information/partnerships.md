## Rari Fuse Pool

Rari Capital has created a Fuse pool in collaboration with Pendle that allows users to collateralise their OT-cDAI and OT-aUSDC and borrow other assets against it. This frees up OT holders' capital and be more efficient in managing their capital while waiting to redeem the OT at expiry. This allows user to leverage on the shorting of yield.
