# Subgraph Data

Pendle uses subgraphs for indexing and organizing data from the Pendle smart contracts. These subgraphs are hosted on The Graph hosted service and can be used to query Pendle data.

## Versions and Production Endpoints
Each subgraph has a dedicated endpoint for querying data, as well as a page on The Graph explorer the exposes the schema and available fields to query.
